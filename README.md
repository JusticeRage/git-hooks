# git-hooks
A simple git hook I use to convert README.md into an HTML page for repositories not hosted on GitHub that users may navigate to.
To use it, simply clone the repository and paste its contents into a repository initialized with `git init --bare`.

[Pandoc](http://pandoc.org/) needs to be installed on the machine.
